An interactive web3D presentation deck for Power Point Slides using X3DOM (www.x3dom.org)

Instructions:
- Create a slide deck in Power Point (PPT). 
- Select Save AS and save the slides as .jpg files. 
- Drop the .jpg images in the slides folder. 

I have included 30 slide panels, viewpoints, and buttons to get you started.
